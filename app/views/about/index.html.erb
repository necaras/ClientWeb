			<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:larger;color:white;">
			
				Welcome to David's Business Supplies Ltd., a family business supplying the Alberta market with 
				cash register rolls for all makes and models of cash registers, point of sale terminals, debit machines and other equipment.
			
			</p>
			<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:larger;color:white;">
				
				David A. McKill (president), a former salesman and branch manager of N.C.R. for over 40 years, opened David's Business Supplies Ltd. in May of 1978 as an authorized dealer of N.C.R. consumable products.
				With his wife (secretary) and his son, David J.S. (vice-president), they operated out of a small warehouse at 10215 - 109 Street in downtown Edmonton, providing N.C.R. products to central and northern Alberta, northwest British Columbia, and the Northwest Territories.
				In 1981, David's Business Supplies Ltd. severed ties with N.C.R., and went on to become an <strong>INDEPENDENT FAMILY BUSINESS</strong>, still providing consumables to the Alberta, British Columbia, and Northwest Territory markets.
				Being <strong>INDEPENDENT</strong>, we are able to supply the markets with a greater product range, and much lower prices.				
				
			</p>
			
			<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:larger;color:white;">
			
				With the passing of David Sr. in 1989, David (J.S.) Jr. continued operating David's Business Supplies Ltd. Outgrowing our location, we moved the business straight north to 10561 - 109 Street in 1991, where the business still resides.
			
			</p>
			<p style="margin-top:15px;font-size:larger;color:white;">
			
				David J.S. took over the senior name, and with the birth of his son, David J.A. (now known as Jr.) came and joined David's Business Supplies Ltd. in July of 2003, thus becoming the third generation involved in the family business.
				We have always strived to not only have low everyday prices and <strong>QUALITY</strong> products, but are still proud of our prompt and efficient service.
